Abstracts
In this study, two data-driven models, artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR), have been optimized to predict the biogas yield from anaerobic digesters. Feature selection and hyperparameter population-based optimization were applied through the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to improve the training modelsâ€™ performance and help them obtain the best input parameters in a reasonable amount of time. Results show that biogas prediction with SVR-GA has the highest accuracy for training and test datasets (with R = 0.854 and RMSE = 0.477 on the training dataset and R = 0.885 and RMSE = 0.492 on the test dataset) in a short training time of 25 minutes. Temperature, pH, effluent and influent dry solids, effluent volatile solids (VS), and influent VS of waste sludge were determined to be the best input parameters that resulted in optimal biogas production, based on their importance in the process.
